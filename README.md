# Hadamard Submatrix Tiling Sets


### Large Scale Things To Do
- Make a C++ Program to Generate Hadamard Submatrices
- Make a C++ Program that incorperates All Tiling Methods
- Thoroughly Analyze Run Time 



### Things To Do In CM.cpp

 - Have CM.cpp only implement the CM Properties
 - Make bool SA[] a vector (to reduce unnecessary allocations)
 - Make int num[] a vector (to prevent potential Out Of Bounds Exceptions)
 - Make function decleration more consitent amongst the whole program
 - Find a way to generate cyclotomic polynomials dynamically
